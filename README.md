# CSV Lint

A Node package to support validating CSV files to check their syntax and contents. You can either use this package within your own JavaScript code, or as a standalone command line application.

## In Development

This package is in development. It is derived, with thanks, from [csvlint.rb](https://github.com/Data-Liberation-Front/csvlint.rb) developed by my friends at [The ODI](https://theodi.org/).
